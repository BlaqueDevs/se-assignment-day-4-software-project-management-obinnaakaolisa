# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Timely delivery is crucial in software projects because delays cost money and trust. As project manager, I'd use task breakdowns, regular meetings, and proper communication to meet deadlines. In my polytechnic projects, setting mini-deadlines always helps us finish on time.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Cost control contributes to success by ensuring we don't run out of resources midway. To prevent budget overruns, I'd use careful estimation, regular expense tracking, and prioritization. Just like when planning our department symposium at FedPolyOko, we always list "must-haves" before "nice-to-haves."

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall methodology is like writing our final year project – sequential steps with clear documentation but inflexible. Agile methodology is like our hackathons – iterative, adaptable, with constant feedback. Both have their place, but my team prefers Agile for most school projects.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

JAMB or banking software would benefit from Waterfall because requirements rarely change and security is paramount. Our campus food delivery app used Agile because we needed to quickly adjust based on student feedback. Different projects need different approaches, just like different Nigerian dishes need different cooking methods!

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

For quality assurance, I'd implement peer code reviews, automated testing, and user testing. Maintaining high standards is like our CGPA – much easier to maintain than to recover after dropping!

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Defining project scope is like creating boundaries for our polytechnic football pitch – it prevents things from going out of bounds. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) helps divide major tasks into smaller ones, like how we break down study topics before exams.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

A detailed project schedule helps coordinate team members just like our class timetable coordinates courses. Gantt charts visually show task timelines, helping identify clashes like when all our assignments are due simultaneously.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

Our software addresses inadequate student accommodation information in Nigerian polytechnics. This problem affects thousands of new students who struggle to find safe, affordable housing near campus each admission season.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

Clearly defining this housing problem helps us focus on what matters: location mapping, security information, and price comparison – not just creating another generic property website.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

Our solution is a mobile platform connecting Nigerian students with verified accommodation options near their campuses, with ratings from other students and transparent pricing.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

Our standout features include campus proximity maps, security incident reporting, landlord ratings from past student tenants, and integration with popular payment platforms like Paystack.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

The Nigerian edutech market is growing at 17% annually, with over 1.9 million students entering polytechnics each year. Student housing represents a ₦800 billion market with minimal digital solutions currently available.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?

Current trends like increasing urbanization around polytechnics and rising security concerns inform our development by emphasizing verification features and neighborhood safety ratings in our solution.
